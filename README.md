## Creative Coding + AI II: Custom Pixel

# Data Mapping Visual Art Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of data visualization and artistic expression through the manipulation of images using p5.js. The work focuses on creating unique visual experiences by combining pixelation effects, color manipulation, and texture overlays.

## Artistic Concept
This project delves into the fascinating intersection of classical art and digital perception. Through the manipulation of ancient sculptures and artifacts.

### Training & Testing
- **Training Panel**: Represents the initial data processing phase, where images are broken down into their fundamental components
- **Testing Panel**: Shows the reinterpretation of classical forms through algorithmic lenses

### Visual Language
- Dense patterns of red and white noise overlay classical forms
- Pixelated textures create a dialogue between digital and analog
- Museum and archaeological backdrops serve as contextual anchors
- The work questions how cultural memory is shaped in the digital age

## Project Goals
- Create visually engaging artwork through data manipulation
- Explore the relationship between input data and visual output
- Develop an interactive system for image transformation
- Investigate the balance between algorithmic precision and artistic expression

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **p5.js**: Main framework for visual processing
- **Python & ChatGPT**: Used for AI-assisted mask generation
- **HTML/CSS**: Web interface and presentation
- **JavaScript**: Custom algorithms for image manipulation

### AI Implementation
The project initially explored using the school's AI system for mask generation, but the results didn't align with the artistic vision. Instead, the project pivoted to using ChatGPT's image generation capabilities, which offered several advantages:

#### ChatGPT Integration
- **Custom Mask Generation**: Created precise masks that better captured the essence of classical sculptures
- **Iterative Refinement**: Ability to quickly iterate and refine mask designs through natural language prompts
- **Artistic Control**: Greater control over the aesthetic quality and composition of the generated masks
- **Style Consistency**: Maintained consistent visual style across multiple pieces

#### Process
1. **Initial Prompting**: Developed specific prompts to generate masks that complement the classical imagery
2. **Mask Refinement**: Iteratively refined the generated masks to achieve desired artistic effects
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly incorporated the AI-generated masks into the p5.js processing pipeline

This approach allowed for a more nuanced exploration of the relationship between classical art and digital processing, while maintaining artistic control over the final output.
